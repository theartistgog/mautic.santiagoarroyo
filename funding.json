When it comes to truly respecting privacy, there are very few marketing tools that can afford true digital sovereignty, guaranteeing ownership of data to avoid vendor lock-in, and offering granular controls over the level and types of tracking used. Mautic stands at the intersection of these needs, offering a powerful solution which can be self-hosted, with features that align with our commitment to being the most privacy-focused marketing automation solution on the market. The vision for this project is to address some issues in our product, enabling better compliance with GDPR and related legislation, and to enable the marketer to easily turn on the tracking features that they wish to use through a central, clear user interface. This will allow Mautic to ship in no-tracking mode, and also educate marketers further on the impact of each form of tracking at the point they turn it on.",

Building on Symfony's AI initiative, we'll develop a comprehensive system enabling marketers to automate complex tasks while keeping sensitive data on-premises. The implementation will include: 1) A pluggable AI interface supporting multiple open source models; 2) Workflow automation agents for campaign optimization, content generation, and segment creation; 3) Transparent operations with human oversight capabilities; and 4)A data privacy layer ensuring no sensitive information leaves the user's infrastructure. This approach democratizes AI capabilities for organizations of all sizes while respecting European values of privacy, transparency, and digital sovereignty. The outcome will be a production-ready, community-maintained framework that transforms Mautic into the first enterprise-grade marketing platform with ethics-first, locally controlled AI capabilities. It will also establish the foundation for future AI-driven features in the open source marketing technology ecosystem, allowing developers to plug in new models and capabilities as they emerge.",

      "description": "Mautic processing of email webhooks from Omnivery, Mailgun and similar Email Service Providers is a bit limited due to insufficient underlying model where we store information coming from webhooks. This proposal aims to add ability to the Mautic core in a way so that transport plugins can leverage them and map it more precisely to the Mautic core model. This will allow better handling of bounces, complaints and other email events, leading to improved deliverability and sender reputation for Mautic users. For the problem described above we're suggesting that we add a complaint flag into the DNC entity so transport plugins can use it when the Email Service Provider suggests so. We would also like to introduce soft bounces into Mautic core in a way so that we still send to contacts that soft bounces, but if the soft bounce happens multiple times that translates to the DNC entity for that lead with a hard bounced flag. How many times contact soft bounces consecutively before it translates to hard bounced will be configurable with the setting in Configuration -> Email Settings. We introduce soft bounce categories so that transport plugins can categorize and we can display that data to the end user. We would add the following filters on segments: filter for DNC complaint reason, soft bounce filter and soft bounce of specific category. We would like to show some more statistics about bounced, soft bounced and complaint contacts on the email list page and to show the count of soft bounces & complaints on the contact page in addition to showing how many soft bounces are left until the hard bounce is set for the given contact. We'll show the count of soft bounces & complaints on email list view.  This will allow marketers to have better insights into their email campaigns and take necessary actions to improve deliverability.",
